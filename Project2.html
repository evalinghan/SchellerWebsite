									<p>
									Upon landing of the Perseverance rover, I started analyzing the abraded rock targets with the SHERLOC instrument, a deep-UV Raman and fluorescence spectrometer.
									Since then, I have focused on constraining deep-UV Raman and fluorescence as a new spectroscopic technique in planetary exploration.
									My team and I made new mineral discoveries that pointed towards ancient aqueous alteration of an igneous rock, known as carbonation, that resulted in carbonate formation.
									I currently focus on understanding how these carbonation reactions occurred and affected the carbon cycle on Mars.
									We also found surprising mixtures of salt minerals, such as perchlorate and sulfates. Last, one of the main goals of the Perseverance rover is to investigate the presence of organic compounds.
									I am currently focusing on constraining SHERLOC's ability to measure ppm-level trace metals and/or organic compounds and how to constrain luminescence spectra analytically and computationally.

									I was a Strategic Process Planning lead in the Mars 2020 team, which means that I planned the overarching traverse, science goals, and science measurements of the extended mission of the Mars 2020 rover by leading a team of ~50 scientists and engineers.
									I have contributed to the official geological map of Jezero Crater as a group leader of a team with 10 other researchers.
									I also constributed significantly to the Mars 2020 landing site working group during landing site selection activities in 2017-2018 by furthering the collective understanding of the Midway and NE Syrtis landing site candidates and proposing possible rover traverses in the NE Syrtis and Midway landing sites.
